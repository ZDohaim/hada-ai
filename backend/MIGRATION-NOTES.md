# GiftRouter Refiner - Migration Notes

## Overview
Successfully implemented conditional FLOWARD routing logic to replace unconditional mandates while maintaining deterministic behavior.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Input Normalization ✅
- **Budget Parsing**: Added `normalizeBudget()` function that handles various formats:
  - Range: "200-400", "300 to 500"
  - Comparison: "under 300", ">500", "~350"
  - Single values: "250"
- **Relationship Mapping**: Close/Professional/Casual tiers
- **Occasion Detection**: Romantic_formal/Practical/Casual classification
- **Category Constraints**: Determines if gifts category is allowed

### 2. System Prompt Redesign ✅
- **Removed**: Unconditional "ALWAYS include FLOWARD" mandate
- **Added**: Conditional preference logic based on normalized signals
- **Simplified**: Clear routing rules with budget bands (Low/Mid/High)
- **Enhanced**: Store-specific quality indicators and search contexts

### 3. Post-Generation Validation ✅
- **JSON Repair Retry**: Single retry on parse failure with repair instruction
- **Conditional FLOWARD Validation**: Only enforces FLOWARD when conditions are met:
  ```javascript
  const shouldIncludeFloward = (
    signals.budgetBand === 'High' || 
    signals.relationshipTier === 'close' || 
    signals.occasionTier === 'romantic_formal'
  ) && signals.allowsGiftsCategory;
  ```
- **Graceful Fallback**: Uses original response if retry fails

### 4. Enhanced Enrichment ✅
- **Case-Insensitive Routing**: `storeNormalized = (g.store || '').trim().toLowerCase()`
- **FLOWARD Keyword Boost**: Automatically adds luxury keywords when missing
- **Normalized Price Ranges**: Uses extracted minPrice/maxPrice from budget parsing

### 5. Configuration Updates ✅
- **Temperature**: 0.7 → 0.3 (reduced drift)
- **Response Format**: Structured JSON object enforcement
- **Cache Key**: Now includes normalized signals for better cache precision

## Test Cases

Run the test suite to verify the new routing logic:
```bash
node test-routing.js
```

### Expected Behavior:
1. **High Budget + Close Relationship** → Should include FLOWARD
2. **Low Budget + Casual** → Should skip FLOWARD  
3. **Mid Budget + Flowers Mention** → Should include FLOWARD
4. **Locked Category** → Should respect constraints

## Migration Checklist

- [x] Input normalization utilities implemented
- [x] System prompt replaced with conditional logic
- [x] Post-generation validation added
- [x] Case-insensitive store routing
- [x] FLOWARD keyword boost implemented
- [x] Temperature lowered to 0.3
- [x] JSON repair retry mechanism
- [x] Test cases created
- [x] Backward compatibility maintained

## Backward Compatibility
✅ **Fully backward compatible** - existing API interface unchanged, only internal routing logic improved.

## Performance Improvements
- **Caching**: GPT responses and API calls cached with normalized keys
- **Throttling**: p-limit controls concurrent API calls (max 3)
- **Reduced API Calls**: Better cache hit rates with normalized signals

## Debugging
Enhanced logging shows:
- Normalized signals for each request
- Validation decisions (when FLOWARD retry triggered)
- Store routing decisions with reasoning

## Key Files Modified
- `server.js`: Main routing logic and system prompt
- `test-routing.js`: Comprehensive test suite
- `MIGRATION-NOTES.md`: This documentation

## Quality Assurance
The new system ensures:
1. **Deterministic routing** based on clear conditions
2. **No unconditional mandates** - FLOWARD only when appropriate
3. **Strict intent adherence** - no generic fallbacks
4. **Robust error handling** with graceful degradation
5. **Performance optimization** through caching and throttling
